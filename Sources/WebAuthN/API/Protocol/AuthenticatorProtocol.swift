     - Parameter allowCredentialDescriptorList: An OPTIONAL list of PublicKeyCredentialDescriptors describing credentials acceptable to the Relying Party (possibly filtered by the client), if any.
     - Parameter requireUserPresence: The constant Boolean value true. It is included here as a pseudo-parameter to simplify applying this abstract authenticator model to implementations that may wish to make a test of user presence optional although WebAuthn does not.
     - Parameter requireUserVerification: The effective user verification requirement for assertion, a Boolean value provided by the client.
     - Parameter extensions: A CBOR map from extension identifiers to their authenticator extension inputs, created by the client based on the extensions requested by the Relying Party, if any.
